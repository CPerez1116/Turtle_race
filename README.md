# 🐢 Turtle Race Game (Python)

A fun and interactive Python console game using the Turtle graphics library.  
Users can **place a bet** on which turtle will win the race, and watch a **randomized turtle race** on the screen.

This project is a **practice project for junior Python developers**, focusing on loops, user input, and using external libraries (turtle).

## 🚀 Features
- Choose a turtle color to bet on  
- Watch a race between six turtles  
- Randomized turtle movement for unpredictability  
- Announce the winner and whether the user’s bet was correct  
- Uses the Turtle graphics library for visualization

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/turtle-race.git
cd turtle-race
```
2. Run the main Python script:
```
python turtle_race.py
```
3. Enter your bet in the prompt and watch the race.

📖 Example Usage
A prompt asks: Which turtle will win the race? Enter a color: blue
Race begins...
You’ve won! The blue turtle is the winner!

📚 What I Learned

How to use the turtle library for graphics

How to generate random movements to simulate a race

Handling user input and comparing it to program results

Using loops to update object positions continuously

Importance of clear comments and readable code

✨ Future Improvements

Add more turtles or different race tracks

Allow multiple players or multiple bets

Add speed levels or obstacles for more challenge

Implement sound effects or animations during the race
